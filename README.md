# 2001 microservice

This is the github repository for my COMP2001 microservice. The micro-service is a profile service for a trails app, and contains 10 endpoints in total. These endpoints allow for CRUD operation on all profiles.

This is the link to my hosted micro-service: https://web.socem.plymouth.ac.uk/comp2001/jlandless/swagger/index.html 

Below are links to some of the resources that I used to build the micro-service.
